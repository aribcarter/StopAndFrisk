# Visualizing Stop and Frisk in NYC

## Inspiration
As part of my summer effort to practice data visualiztion, I chose to participate in the Storytelling with Data monthly challenge, and even though I was late to the part, wanted to do the [June Black and White Challenge](https://community.storytellingwithdata.com/challenges/52e943ac-9468-4b4e-a8d8-14eadd6a3394). I found the theme appropriate due to the BLM protests- a cause that emphasizes the contrast between black and white experiences, especially experiences related to policing. Thus, my goal for this visualiztion is to provide a sense of the qualitative and quantitative difference for how people of different races feel the NYPD's presence. 

My hope to make to make a page in the vein of Shirley Wu's [Movie Flower](http://bl.ocks.org/sxywu/raw/8d1b563586bf411383345e95a3418715/) visualization where black and white stop and frisk statistics as documented by the NYPD are visualized differently shaped breaks in glass as an allusion to broken window policing.

## Process
1. I first used R to port in 17 years of data from the NYPD and clean it so each year's datasheet plays nice with the others
